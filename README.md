# Strings-cleaning
The following code changes all commas to points in selected .txt files as well as finds specific record

There are two different main scripts here:
- from_comma_to_point
- search

from_comma_to_point script works in conjunction with interface_1 and you can choose any folder with any amount of .txt files in it and the script will change all commas to points in these files.

search script works in conjunction with interface_2 and with its help you can find a line in any .txt file which contains a specific value of your interest.

The tool was done for a PhD who holds a Post Doc position in University of Montreal who does studies in Physics and who was in need to convert .txt files in the fashion described above.
